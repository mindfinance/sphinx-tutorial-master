Docs Space Content
--------------------------------------------------

.. tip::
  Here you will find the following content :

  * Business Intelligence projects documentation
  * Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models documentation (Visual and Textual)
  * Big Data usage documentation
  * Product team documentation
    

.. note::
  The content will be classified to four main categories :

  1. PCC - Per Customer Content 
     PCC is a micro view over projects that are customer - centered,
     which means each customer has its own documentation for its unique
     product.

  2. GCC - General Company's Content
     GCC is a macro view over projects that are not customer - centered.
     GCC projects often refers to DataWiz's domain of work or to general models and system 
     which are being shared by multiple customers,
     e.g general AI/ML models, general BI systems that multiple customers share etc..

  3. Product Team documentations
     This space is designed for the documentation of the product team's work on new
     products, systems, projects, ideas, models, code etc..
     Products are being nested in platforms.

  4. Platform Team documentations
     This space is designed for the documentation of the platform team's work on new
     platforms and the relevant UI/UX, interaction with customers and models already deployed.
     Platforms host the products.
