Docs Space Content
--------------------------------------------------

.. important::
  Here you will find the following content :

  * Business Intelligence projects documentation
  * Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models documentation (Visual and Textual)
  * Big Data usage documentation
  * Product team documentation
    
  The content will be classified to two main categories :

  1. PCC - Per Customer Content 
     PCC is a micro view over projects that are customer - centered,
     which means each customer has its own documentation for its unique
     product.

  2. GCC - General Company's Content
     GCC is a macro view over projects that are not customer - centered.
     GCC projects often refers to DataWiz's domain of work or to general models and system 
     which are being shared by multiple customers,
     e.g general AI/ML models, general BI systems that multiple customers share etc..
