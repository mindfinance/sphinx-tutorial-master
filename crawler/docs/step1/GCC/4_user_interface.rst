User Interfaces
---------------
How does a user interact with the system.

.. todo::
  If you have a user interacting with the finished system, and especially if you have a UI or GUI, describe how it can be used.
  A good way of doing this, is by building a

  - state transition diagram aka the 'Dynamic UI Behaviuour' and
  - a mockup/picture of every screen the user can see - aka 'Static UI'

  Don't overdo it...
